 This thesis investigates gentrification in Madrid, focusing on identifying at-risk neighborhoods and understanding their relationship to the gentrification process. By analyzing demographic characteristics, socioeconomic indicators, housing prices, and Airbnb data primarily obtained from the Ayto. de Madrid (Madrid City Council), a cluster analysis was performed. The findings reveal the spatial distribution of high-risk gentrification areas and provide insights into influential factors. This study enhances the understanding of gentrification dynamics and patterns in Madrid, contributing to the broader knowledge of the process and its identification.
